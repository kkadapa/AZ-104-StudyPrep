    <p>You should set a budget and alerts because it's almost a certainty that at some point you will create resources, and then forget to stop them or delete them. Save yourself some nasty $100 charges with notifications!

Follow the video in the previous lesson to set a budget.

VERY IMPORTANT Note:

1) You don't need a budget with a free account. Azure isn't actually charging you, and I believe the functionality doesn't work for free accounts.

2) For pay as you go accounts, it takes 24-48 hours from the time you created the account for the budget features to be activated. So if you JUST created an account, you will have to wait. Errors in this section are expected for new accounts.
